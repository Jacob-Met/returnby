# ReturnBy

ReturnBy turns an order-confirmation email into a reviewable return deadline and a calendar reminder. The visitor supplies the email text; the browser runs the repository's real rule-based parser, merchant-policy lookup, date calculation, status logic and RFC 5545 export. It is a multi-order tracker, not a canned result: correct extracted fields, override a return window, save several deadlines, filter the list and export a three-day alarm for any order.

## Privacy

The original pasted email is not sent or persisted. The user must review and save fields; only merchant, order number, total, order date, return-window days and timestamps are kept in this browser's local storage. There is no account, inbox connection, analytics, external API or model call. Clearing the list removes saved records from this device.

## Correct a saved return

Choose **Edit details** on a saved order. The separate editor keeps the original saved deadline visible beside the proposed deadline while you correct the store, date, return window, order number or total. **Save changes** replaces that one reviewed order; **Cancel** or Escape leaves it untouched. The original ID and creation time remain, so its calendar UID stays the same. Download a new calendar reminder after saving if needed; files already imported into a calendar do not change automatically.

The editor accepts real dates from years 1000–9999 and positive whole-day windows with a deadline before 9999-12-31, leaving room for the calendar reminder's next-day end date. Text fields are limited to 4,096 characters. Changing the merchant or window recalculates the source label using the existing local policy table. Corrections to other fields preserve the saved source label and duration, including historical fallback values. These labels do not verify a retailer's current terms.

An unsuccessful read or save keeps both the old saved data and your edit draft. If this order changed or was removed while the editor was open, saving is refused and the tracker refreshes; cancel and reopen the editor to review its latest saved version. New or changed unrelated orders are preserved by reading the saved tracker immediately before committing. This check does not create a transaction across simultaneous writes in different tabs. Your separate new-order draft and pasted text stay in place throughout editing.

## Run and verify

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

The optional Raider browser acceptance and desktop/phone captures run through `py -3 tools/capture_returnby.py` (requires Playwright and Chromium/Chrome). The sample orders use fictional merchants; the parser's policy table is a convenience, not a guarantee from any retailer. Users should confirm a deadline with the store's current terms.

The saved-order browser acceptance runs with `node tools/check_edit_browser.mjs` against a local production preview. It requires Playwright and Chromium; `RETURNBY_PLAYWRIGHT` and `RETURNBY_CHROME` may point at existing installations, `RETURNBY_BASE_URL` selects the local preview, and `RETURNBY_DOWNLOAD_DIR` can select a shared writable download directory for a confined browser. `RETURNBY_BASELINE_URL` optionally checks a separately served original build, and `RETURNBY_CAPTURE_DIR` saves results and captures. `tools/check_edit_backup_browser.mjs` is an additional receiving check for a composition containing portable-backup PR #10; it exercises a restored order through editing, export and restoration, plus stale import previews. The exact qualification and composition pins are in `docs/receipts/saved-order-edit-20261008.json`.

## Implementation

- `src/parse.ts`: order-date, merchant, order-number and total extraction.
- `src/policy.ts` / `data/policies.json`: merchant lookup with an editable 30-day fallback.
- `src/deadline.ts`: date arithmetic and urgency states.
- `src/store.ts`: local-only persistence of approved fields.
- `src/edit.ts` / `src/edit-ui.ts`: reviewed corrections with stable order identity and conflict/storage refusal.
- `src/ics.ts`: calendar reminder generation.
